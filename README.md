This is a discord bot that will keep track of the number of times a user is late! Add this to a server if you want a counter for how often someone says they are going to be late! The code infastructure implements GPT API to determine if the message sent by a user will indicate of they are late, and then using a hashmap will increment the count for the user. It is currently finished the only file you really need is the Late Accountability File. The others you can ignore!
